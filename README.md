# Kernel of Quantum
Resources for learning Quantum Computing.

This is the source for the site hosted on Githup pages.
https://stevefroehlich.github.io/

The purpose is to create tools for people interested in learning
about Quantum Computing. There is a lot of great content online
that people can learn from. The intent of this effort is to create
problems, exams and solutions where people can verify what they know.
This is an attempt to solve the frustrating problem of reading 
(or watching) some meterial and having no idea what you actually 
retained. (without enrolling in a formal course)

If you are interested in contributing you can copy some of the existing
pages source and create pages for other content or add problems to existing
pages.
