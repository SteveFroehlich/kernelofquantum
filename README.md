# Kernel of Quantum
Resources for learning Quantum Computing.

This is the source for the site hosted on Githup pages.
https://stevefroehlich.github.io/

The purpose is to create tools for people interested in learning
about Quantum Computing. There is a lot of great content (websites/
books/articles/videos) that people can learn from. The intent of this effort 
is to create problems, exams and solutions where people can verify what 
they know. This is an attempt to add more structure, resources and 
help for those who want to learn quantum computing. (without enrolling 
in a formal course)

The solution involves two parts. First a website that provides problems 
for a concept. Then toggles for the answer to the problem as well as 
the steps taken to get to that answer. Those steps are referred to as 
the solution. For example see 
https://stevefroehlich.github.io/linear_algebra/matrix_arithmetic/matrix_arithmetic.html 
and the source
https://github.com/SteveFroehlich/kernelofquantum/blob/master/linear_algebra/matrix_arithmetic/matrix_arithmetic.html
Other examples of concepts are quantum Fourier transform, Turing Machines, 
quantum counting or any of the minor sections from the standard text book.

The second part is links to a subreddit where people can
ask questions when they get stuck and a community can form around 
helping them. There is also a subreddit for people
to post content like lectures, books or other resources which helps 
teach the material the problem is pertaining to and rank the best content. 
See the Question and Content buttons at the bottom of the matrix_arithmetic 
page.

pages source and create pages for other content or add problems to existing
